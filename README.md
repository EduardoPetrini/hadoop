# Apriori Algorithm Implementations on MapReduce and Spark

This projec contains some Apriori implementations on Hadoop/MapReduce and Spark. The implementations is organized in branchs as follow:

### Hadoop
 - IMRApriori v2 (Farzanier & Cercone, 2013) named here as IMRAprioriAcc in dev/IMRAprioriAcc branch.
 - DPC (Lin et al, 2012) in dev/DPC branch.
 - CPA (Zhou & Huange, 2014) in dev/CPA branch.

### Spark
 - IMRAprioriAcc on Spark in dev/IMRAprioriAcc-Spark branch.
 - DPC on Spark in dev/DPC-Spark branch.
 - CPA on Spark in dev/CPA-Spark branch.
 - IMRAprioriAcc with Cpa on Spark in dev/IMRAprioriAcc-Cpa-Spark branch.
